    This page returns a
    <code>cache-control: no-store</code>
    response header. This instructs the browser to not cache the response.

  <p>
    The timestamp above was generated on the server and shows the freshness of
    the server's response. This value is updated once every 60 seconds. If you
    refresh the page and 60 seconds have elapsed, this value will be updated
    with the latest server time. Throughout this demo, it will be used to
    demonstrate whether the server response is stale or fresh. On your website,
    this is likely to be data retrieved by the server from a CMS or API.
