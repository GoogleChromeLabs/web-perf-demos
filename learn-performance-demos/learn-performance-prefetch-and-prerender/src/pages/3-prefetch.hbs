    If you observe the network tab after the navigation, you should notice that
    the document is fetched instantly from the
    <i>prefetch cache</i>. Similarly to <code>link rel=&quot;prefetch&quot;</code>, if the user navigates to the prefetched
    page before the request has completed, the browser reuses the partially
    downloaded resource instead of opening a new connection.
