    This demo includes four images. Two of the images are within or close to the
    viewport, while the remaining two are outside of the viewport. However
    <i>all</i>
    images have the
    <code>loading=&quot;lazy&quot;</code>
    attribute. This is an anti-pattern and can potentially delay the LCP image.

  <p>
    If you observe the Chrome DevTools network panel, you should notice that the
    images within the initial viewport do not start downloading until all CSS is
    downloaded and parsed. This is because the browser does not know if the
    image is within the viewport until after the layout phase.

      alt="Chrome DevTools Network panel showing 5 resources. The images (bottom two rows) begin downloading after style.css has finished downloading."
      loading="lazy"
    />
  </p>
  <p>
    In the network panel above, the images
    <code>image-1.jpg</code>
    and
    <code>image-2.jpg</code>
    do not start downloading until
    <code>style.css</code>
    has finished downloading. Contrast this with the previous demo where the LCP
    image was downloaded immediately.
